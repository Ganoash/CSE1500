X-Cache:
The 'X-' indicates that the header is not part of the spec.
The X-Cache tag indicates whether anything has been found in the web cache. If this isn't the case, the tag will show: 'MISS'.
If something has been found, however, the tag will show: 'HIT'.

1.4)
The Cache-Control HTTP header specifies browser caching policies in both client requests and server responses. Policies include how a resource is cached, where itâ€™s cached and its maximum age before expiring.
